# Static Website Deployment on AWS

This repository contains the necessary files and instructions for deploying a static website to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Static websites are ideal for hosting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that do not require server-side processing.

## Project Overview

The cloud is a great choice for hosting static websites due to its scalability and cost-effectiveness. In this project, we will:

1. Create an S3 Bucket: We'll set up an AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) bucket to store our website files.

2. Configure Bucket for Website Hosting: We'll configure the S3 bucket to serve as a website host.

3. Secure the Bucket: We'll enhance security using AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies.

4. Upload Website Files: All website content, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images, will be uploaded to the S3 bucket.

5. Speed Up Content Delivery: We'll improve website performance by leveraging AWS CloudFront, a content delivery network (CDN).

6. Access the Website: Finally, we'll provide instructions on how to access the deployed static website.

## File Summary

- `index.html`: The main HTML document for the website.
- `/img`: Folder containing the background image for the website.
